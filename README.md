Porter2 English Stemmer
=======================

This is an INCOMPLETE implementation of the [Porter2 english stemmer](http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/english/stemmer.html) written in Rust. It's a little toy project for me to learn Rust on, while doing something somewhat useful.

I'm currently using Rust v0.11.0.

Many thanks to the start that [mrordinaire's porter stemmer in rust](https://github.com/mrordinaire/rust-stem) gave me!!
